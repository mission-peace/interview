/**
 * There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
 * Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
 *
 * Solution
 * Take minimum size of two array. Possible number of partitions are from 0 to m in m size array.
 * Try every cut in binary search way. When you cut first array at i then you cut second array at (m + n + 1)/2 - i
 * Now try to find the i where a[i-1] <= b[j] and b[j-1] <= a[i]. So this i is partition around which lies the median.
 *
 * Time complexity is O(log(min(x,y))
 * Space complexity is O(1)
