Problem Statement
=================

Given different dimensions and unlimited supply of boxes for each dimension, stack boxes on top of each other such that
it has maximum height but with caveat that length and width of box on top should be strictly less than length and width
of box under it. You can rotate boxes as you like.

1) Create all rotations of boxes such that length is always greater or equal to width
2) Sort boxes by base area in non increasing order (length * width). This is because box
   with more area will never ever go on top of box with less area.
3) Take T[] and result[] array of same size as total boxes after all rotations are done
4) Apply longest increasing subsequence type of algorithm to get max height.

Analysis
--------
If n number of dimensions are given total boxes after rotation will be 3n.
* Space complexity is O(n)
* Time complexity - O(nlogn) to sort boxes. O(n^2) to apply DP on it So really O(n^2)
